This is my attempt at making a mario-like platfolrmer using C and raylib. I am starting with 0 knowledge or experience with C and going from there.

TODO list:

1.Create enemies struct

2.Create enemy collision which restarts the game

3.Create more functional platforms and better floor collision.

4.make enemy movement

5.find tutorial for c assets... dont be dumb again
